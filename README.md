# Calculator-Application
## Overview
The Calculator Application is a simple command-line utility that performs basic arithmetic operations. This project is implemented in C++ and is designed to demonstrate fundamental programming concepts such as functions, control structures, and input/output handling.
## Features
- *Addition*: Adds two numbers and displays the result.
- *Subtraction*: Subtracts the second number from the first and displays the result.
- *Multiplication*: Multiplies two numbers and displays the result.
- *Division*: Divides the first number by the second and displays the result, with error handling for division by zero.
- *Exit*: Exits the application gracefully.
## Usage
Upon running the application, you will be presented with a menu to choose from the available operations. You can perform any of the basic arithmetic operations by entering the corresponding symbol. The application will prompt you to enter two numbers and then display the result of the operation.
## Example
===== Calculator Menu =====
- Enter + for addition.
- Enter - for subtraction.
- Enter * for multiplication.
- Enter / for division.
- Enter q to quit.
- Choose an operation:+.
- Enter first number: 10.
- Enter second number: 5.
In this example, the user chose the addition operation (+) and entered the numbers 10 and 5, resulting in 15.
