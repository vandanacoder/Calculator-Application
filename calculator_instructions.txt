Calculator Program Instructions
1.Startup and Menu Display
When you run the program, it will display a menu with available operations.
The menu options are:
+ for addition

2.Choosing an Operation

If you enter 'q' or 'Q', the program will terminate and display "Exiting the calculator. Goodbye!".

3.Input Numbers
After choosing an operation (except 'q'), the program prompts you to enter two numbers.

4.Performing the Calculation
The program will then perform the selected operation on the two entered numbers.

If you choose division ('/'), the program checks if the second number (divisor) is zero.
If it is zero, the program displays an error message: "Error: Division by zero is not allowed." and prompts for another operation.
Otherwise, it performs the division and displays the result.

6.Invalid Operation Handling
If you enter an invalid operation symbol (not one of '+', '-', '*', '/', 'q', 'Q'), the program will display: "Invalid operation. Please try again." and prompt for another operation.
